- A clear title and short description
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots or console errors (if helpful)

## Issues i found

- To begin with i had far too much code for what was required which made it very messy and difficult to navigate
- I ended up with multiple files that were doing the same task...again messy
- I hardcoded things that could have been created more dynamically and efficiently
- I did not have a clear vision of what i wanted the finished product to look like 
- Not being as familiar with VScode and Git, which was a learning curve itself
